* <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>: The YUI Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX.

* <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a>: A source-to-source translator for securing Javascript-based web content

This project requires the full source tree for YUI2 and Caja, both publically available.

Quick start:

<notextile>
<pre>
[~] ➔ mkdir src; cd src
[~/src] ➔ svn checkout http://google-caja.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ google-caja
[~/src] ➔ git clone git://github.com/yui/yui2.git
[~/src] ➔ git clone git://github.com/apm/yui-caja.git
[~/src] ➔ cd google-caja
[~/src/google-caja] ➔ ant testbed
[~/src] ➔ cd ../yui-caja
[~/src/yui-caja] ➔ ant
[~/src/yui-caja] ➔ open tests/core_host.html (open with a web browser, this may need to be served through a local web server)
</pre>
</notextile>

p. Todo:

* Replace the script execs with the cajole task should it exist, or create one.
* Host file build step that generates the correct urls to the caja environment based on the caja.base property.
* Replace existing tests with yuitest tests once yuitest is cajoled.
* Document capabilities and known issues for each component.
