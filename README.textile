h2. YUI-Caja

This projects contains files related to the effort to cajole YUI 2.8.0.

* <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>: The YUI Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX.

* <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a>: A source-to-source translator for securing Javascript-based web content

This project requires the full source tree for Caja in a sibling directory.

Quick start:

<notextile>
<pre>
[~] ➔ mkdir src; cd src
[~/src] ➔ svn checkout http://google-caja.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ google-caja
[~/src] ➔ git clone git://github.com/apm/yui-caja.git
[~/src] ➔ cd google-caja
[~/src/google-caja] ➔ ant testbed
[~/src/google-caja] ➔ cd ../yui-caja
[~/src/yui-caja] ➔ . create_symlinks.sh
[~/src/yui-caja] ➔ ant all
</pre>
</notextile>

Then open tests/index.php in a web browser.  This will require a local web server running PHP.

The full download bundle of YUI 2.8.0 is included in the yui-caja project folder in the yui2.8 subfolder.

The index page summarizes the current status of the cajoling and testing process for YUI 2.  Test suites and examples are all powered by a single host.php that wraps the cajoled test and example pages (referred to as gadgets after cajoling).  host.php operates by reading the value of the 'test' query string parameter for which cajoled file will be injected into the host body.

FireBug Lite is automatically loaded into the host page in IE6 and 7.

p. Todo:

* Host file build step that generates the correct urls to the caja environment based on the caja.base property.
* Update test results in index.php
* Fix the YUI Test suite links to point to new test pages
* Go through each component's examples and document in the notes.js its capabilities and known issues.  This is in parallel to filing bugs with Caja
* Remove all LOG messages in the build-all log, looking for alarming WARNINGs or ERRORs
